This idea started as I was designing a site with a beer theme.

It seemed like it would be fun to have a 'beer carbonation bubble' effect that would be easy to add to a page.
I didn't find any existing libraries on the Internet, so I decided it would be fun to roll my own.

It was also a good excuse to learn how to use the HTML5 canvas element.

USAGE:
  Simply add the script to the HTML page in the HEAD element
  
ISSUES:
  CPU usage is really high
  I'm not even sure if I'm doing it correctly. I'm open to suggestions.
