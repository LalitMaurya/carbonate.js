This idea started as I was designing a site with a beer theme.

It seemed like it would be fun to have a 'beer carbonation bubble' effect that would be easy to add to a page.
I didn't find any existing libraries on the Internet, so I decided it would be fun to roll my own.

It was also a good excuse to learn how to use the HTML5 canvas element and explore JavaScript as a language.

USAGE:
  Include carbonate.js in your head tag:

    <script type="text/javascript" src="carbonate.js"></script> 

  After the document is loaded initialize carbonate:

    var carbonate = new Carbonate();
    carbonate.start();
  
  There are a few options you can use to customize the bubbles:

    var carbonate = new Carbonate({
      fps: 10, // limit to 10 frames per second
      num_bubbles_at_a_time: 2, // number of bubbles to make at once
      min_bubble_distance: 2, // min distance to raise a bubble by
      max_bubble_distance: 10, // max distance to raise a bubble by
      min_bubble_width: 2, // min width (diameter) of a bubble
      max_bubble_width: 18 // max width (diameter) of a bubble
    });
    carbonate.start();

  
ISSUES:
  I pushed the injected canvas element down by setting z-index to -1. Would it be better to lift everything else off the page (z-index: 1) instead
