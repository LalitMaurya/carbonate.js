This idea started as I was designing a site with a beer theme.

It seemed like it would be fun to have a 'beer carbonation bubble' effect that would be easy to add to a page.
I didn't find any existing libraries on the Internet, so I decided it would be fun to roll my own.

It was also a good excuse to learn how to use the HTML5 canvas element and explore JavaScript as a language.

USAGE:
  Simply add the script to the HTML page in the HEAD element
  Call carbonate() to run. 
  Carbonate takes two parameters--a toggle function (to turn bubbles on and off) and an options object
  View the HTML demo to learn how to set up a toggle function
  
ISSUES:
  I pushed the injected canvas element down by setting z-index to -1. Would it be better to lift everything else off the page (z-index: 1) instead
